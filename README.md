# Image Create :: OPNsense on Digital Ocean

Terraform module to create a Digital Ocean Droplet snapshot-image that can subsequently be used to start an OPNsense
instance within Digital Ocean.

- [OPNsense](https://www.opnsense.org/)
- [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)

This module provides an boot-time syshook for OPNsense that collects input parameters from the Digital Ocean (Open
Stack based) meta-data and applies them to the OPNsense `config.xml` file at boot. Config attributes that are
managed this way include:-

- root user sshkey
- Public and Private network interface cards
- IPv4 address, subnet, gateway, dns
- IPv6 address, subnet, gateway

This allows the resulting OPNsense Droplet Image to be used in regular Terraform devops automation situations. Additionally,
users of the resulting OPNsense instance can inject `user-data` scripts at initial instance boot, however the system
does not include cloudinit, so `user-data` scripts need to be contained `/bin/sh` scripts.

## Usage

This module is mildly unusual in that the final result does **not** provide a running Droplet. The correct behaviour
of this module will result in a Digital Ocean Droplet image while the Droplet used in the process of creating the image
will self destruct.

The example below shows an example setup - note that the **root_passwd** variable is optional and by default will
use the same default password that OPNsense uses, that is "opnsense" - be smart, change this because your OPNsense
instance will be **publicly** accessible to begin with unless you take other measures to prevent inbound access to
TCP22 (SSH) and TCP443 (HTTPS).

```hcl
variable "do_token" {}    # set via environment value `TF_VAR_do_token`

module "opnsense-image" {
  source  = "verbnetworks/opnsense-image/digitalocean"

  opnsense_release = "18.7"
  root_passwd = "honeyPot..."

  digitalocean_region = "sgp1"
  digitalocean_token = "${var.do_token}"

  do_opnsense_install = 1
  do_cleanup_shutdown = 1
  do_image = 1
  do_self_destruct = 1
}

output "provider" { value = "${module.opnsense-image.provider}"}
output "region" { value = "${module.opnsense-image.region}"}
output "build_id" { value = "${module.opnsense-image.build_id}"}
output "image_name" { value = "${module.opnsense-image.image_name}"}
output "image_action_outfile" { value = "${module.opnsense-image.image_action_outfile}"}
```

After the build process completes you should observe among the final Terraform log lines the following, thus indicating
the build process is complete and the image is taking place on the Digital Ocean backend.

```text
action-status (local-exec): !!!!
action-status (local-exec): !!!! build_id: YDYAKA
action-status (local-exec): !!!! image_name: OPNsense 18.1 - 20180717Z102528
action-status (local-exec): !!!! image_action_outfile: /tmp/opnsense-YDYAKA-image-action.json
action-status (local-exec): !!!!
action-status (local-exec): !!!! Remember to terraform destroy resources once image action is complete
action-status (local-exec): !!!!
```

The user should perform a `terraform destroy` once complete to remove the resources that have allocated in the local
`tfstate` - they can all safely be destroyed, the new Droplet image will not be removed in this destroy action because
the action to create the image is performed as a `local-exec` call to `curl` thus preventing it from being a Terraform
resource.

## Use your new Droplet Image

You are now able to start a new Digital Ocean Droplet using the image just created by selecting the image from
the "Snapshots" tab under the "Choose an image" heading when starting a new Droplet through the Digital Ocean web-
console.

## Warning!

The default rules used in this arrangement differ from the default OPNsense rules in that they **allow** access to the
OPNsense control interfaces via TCP22 (SSH) and TCP443 (HTTPS) to facilitate your initial connection(s) to the
system for setup etc.

Leaving the system in this arrangement is **NOT** recommended and you should take steps to restrict the source
addresses that can connect to your OPNsense control interfaces.

## Notes and Observations

- The image "build" process leverages the OPNsense provided `opnsense-bootstrap.sh` tool to "convert" a FreeBSD
  Droplet into an OPNsense one, check it out here - [https://github.com/opnsense/update](https://github.com/opnsense/update)
- Builds generally take around 10 minutes when using a small-sized Digital Ocean Droplet size.
- You will see a **lot** of Terraform log output as the build process continues, keep in mind that builds can fail for
  many surprising reasons, external packages may not download and kernel-panics have been observed, so it is worth
  keeping an eye on the Terraform logging output to make sure nothing really obvious is going wrong.
- The Digital Ocean API can act mysteriously at times, several times it has been observed that the final Droplet
  image process silents fails to register the new Droplet snapshot, the resolution seems to be just `destroying`
  and going through the process again without changing anything.
- Remember to issue the `terraform destroy` at the end, else you may become confused what state you are in the next
  time to come to roll another Droplet based OPNsense image.

## What about Packer?

Packer, also produced by Hashicorp is an awesome tool, but requires learning yet another tool-chain. Since the resulting
Digital Ocean images are targeted at DevOps people that use Terraform, it just felt more natural to do the whole build
process in Terraform.

## History

This module was originally published via `github.com/ndejong/terraform-digitalocean-opnsense-cloud-image-builder` and was
subsequently moved which required it to be removed and re-added within the Terraform Module repository.
